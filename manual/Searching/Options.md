# Search options

SQL [SELECT](Searching/Full_text_matching/Basic_usage.md#SQL) clause supports a number of options that can be used to fine-tune search behaviour.

## OPTION
```ini
SELECT ... OPTION <optionname>=<value> [ , ... ]
```

Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM test WHERE MATCH('@title hello @body world')
OPTION ranker=bm25, max_matches=3000,
    field_weights=(title=10, body=3), agent_query_timeout=10000
```

Supported options and respectively allowed values are:

### agent_query_timeout
Integer. Max time in milliseconds to wait for remote queries to complete, see [this section](Creating_an_index/Creating_a_distributed_index/Remote_indexes.md#agent_query_timeout).

### boolean_simplify
0 or 1, enables [simplifying the query](Searching/Full_text_matching/Boolean_optimization.md) to speed it up

### comment
String, user comment that gets copied to a query log file

### cutoff
Integer. Max found matches threshold.

### field_weights
Named integer list (per-field user weights for ranking)

### global_idf
Use global statistics (frequencies) from the [global_idf](Creating_an_index/NLP_and_tokenization/Low-level_tokenization.md#global_idf) file for IDF computations.

### idf
Quoted, comma-separated list of IDF computation flags. Known flags are:

* normalized: BM25 variant, idf = log((N-n+1)/n), as per Robertson et al
* plain: plain variant, idf = log(N/n), as per Sparck-Jones
* tfidf_normalized: additionally divide IDF by query word count, so that `TF*IDF` fits into [0, 1] range
* tfidf_unnormalized: do not additionally divide IDF by query word count where N is the collection size and n is the number of matched documents

The historically default IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) in Manticore is equivalent to `OPTION idf='normalized,tfidf_normalized'`, and those normalizations may cause several undesired effects.

First, idf=normalized causes keyword penalization. For instance, if you search for `the | something` and `the` occurs in more than 50% of the documents, then documents with both keywords `the` and `something` will get less weight than documents with just one keyword `something`. Using `OPTION idf=plain` avoids this. Plain IDF varies in `[0, log(N)]` range, and keywords are never penalized; while the normalized IDF varies in [-log(N), log(N)] range, and too frequent keywords are penalized.

Second, idf=tfidf_normalized causes IDF drift over queries. Historically, we additionally divided IDF by query keyword count, so that the entire `sum(tf*idf)` over all keywords would still fit into [0,1] range. However, that means that queries `word1` and `word1 | nonmatchingword2` would assign different weights to the exactly same result set, because the IDFs for both `word1` and `nonmatchingword2` would be divided by 2. `OPTION idf='tfidf_unnormalized'` fixes that. Note that BM25, BM25A, BM25F() ranking factors will be scale accordingly once you disable this normalization.

IDF flags can be mixed; `plain` and `normalized` are mutually exclusive; `tfidf_unnormalized` and `tfidf_normalized` are mutually exclusive; and unspecified flags in such a mutually exclusive group take their defaults. That means that `OPTION idf=plain` is equivalent to a complete `OPTION idf='plain,tfidf_normalized'` specification.

### local_df
0 or 1,automatically sum DFs over all the local parts of a distributed index, so that the IDF is consistent (and precise) over a locally sharded index.

### index_weights
Named integer list. Per-index user weights for ranking.

### max_matches
Integer. Per-query max matches value.

Maximum amount of matches that the server keeps in RAM for each index and can return to the client. Default is 1000.

Introduced in order to control and limit RAM usage, `max_matches` setting defines how much matches will be kept in RAM while searching each index. Every match found will still be processed; but only best N of them will be kept in memory and return to the client in the end. Assume that the index contains 2,000,000 matches for the query. You rarely (if ever) need to retrieve all of them. Rather, you need to scan all of them, but only choose “best” at most, say, 500 by some criteria (ie. sorted by relevance, or price, or anything else), and display those 500 matches to the end user in pages of 20 to 100 matches. And tracking only the best 500 matches is much more RAM and CPU efficient than keeping all 2,000,000 matches, sorting them, and then discarding everything but the first 20 needed to display the search results page. `max_matches` controls N in that "best N" amount.

This parameter noticeably affects per-query RAM and CPU usage. Values of 1,000 to 10,000 are generally fine, but higher limits must be used with care. Recklessly raising max_matches to 1,000,000 means that `searchd` will have to allocate and initialize 1-million-entry matches buffer for every query. That will obviously increase per-query RAM usage, and in some cases can also noticeably impact performance.

### max_query_time
Sets maximum search query time, in milliseconds. Must be a non-negative integer. Default value is 0 which means "do not limit". Local search queries will be stopped once that much time has elapsed. Note that if you're performing a search which queries several local indexes, this limit applies to each index separately. Note it may increase the query's response time a little bit, the overhead is caused by constant tracking if it's time to stop the query.

### max_predicted_time
Integer. Max predicted search time, see [predicted_time_costs](Server_settings/Searchd.md#predicted_time_costs).

### ranker
Any of:
* `proximity_bm25`
* `bm25`
* `none`
* `wordcount`
* `proximity`
* `matchany`
* `fieldmask`
* `sph04`
* `expr`
* or `export`

Refer to [Search results ranking](Searching/Sorting_and_ranking.md) for more details on each ranker.

### retry_count
Integer. Distributed retries count.

### retry_delay
Integer. Distributed retry delay, msec.

### reverse_scan
0 or 1, lets you control the order in which full-scan query processes the rows.

### sort_method
* `pq` - priority queue, set by default
* `kbuffer` - gives faster sorting for already pre-sorted data, e.g. index data sorted by id
The result set is in both cases the same; picking one option or the other may just improve (or worsen!) performance.

### rand_seed
Lets you specify a specific integer seed value for an `ORDER BY RAND()` query, for example: `... OPTION rand_seed=1234`. By default, a new and different seed value is autogenerated for every query

### low_priority
Runs the query with idle priority

### expand_keywords
0 or 1, expand keywords with exact forms and/or stars when possible. Refer to [expand_keywords](Creating_an_index/NLP_and_tokenization/Wildcard_searching_settings.md#expand_keywords) for more details.

### token_filter
Quoted, colon-separated of `library name:plugin name:optional string of settings`. Query-time token filter gets created on search each time full-text invoked by every index involved and let you implement a custom tokenizer that makes tokens according to custom rules. 
```sql
SELECT * FROM index WHERE MATCH ('yes@no') OPTION token_filter='mylib.so:blend:@'
```

### morphology
`none` allows to replace all query terms with their exact forms if index was built with [index_exact_words](Creating_an_index/NLP_and_tokenization/Morphology.md#index_exact_words) enabled. Useful to prevent stemming or lemmatizing query terms.
