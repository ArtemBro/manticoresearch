# Faceted search 

Faceted search is as essential function of a modern search application as [autocomplete](Searching/Autocomplete.md), [spell correction](Searching/Spell_correction.md) and search keywords [highlighting](Searching/Highlighting.md). Especially in E-commerce products.

![Faceted search](faceted.png)

It comes to the rescue when we deal with large amounts of data and various properties related to each other, whether it is size, color, manufacturer or something else. When querying large amounts of data search results often include large swaths of entries which does not fit userâ€™s expectations. Faceted search allows an end-user to explicitly specify the dimensions that they want their search results to meet.

In Manticore Search there is an optimization that retains the result set of the original query and reuses it for each facet calculation. As the aggregations are applied to already calculated subset of documents they are fast and the total execution time can be in many cases only marginally bigger than the initial query. Facets can be added to any query and the facet can be any attribute or expression. A facet result contains the facet values along with the facet counts. Facets are available using SQL `SELECT` statement by declaring them at the very end of the query.

## Aggregations

<!-- example Example_1 -->

The facet values can come from an attribute, JSON property from a JSON attribute or expression. Facet values can be also aliased, however the **alias must be unique** across all result sets (main query results set and other facets results sets). The facet value is taken from the aggregated attribute/expression, but it can also come from another attribute/expression.

```sql
FACET {expr_list} [BY {expr_list}] [ORDER BY {expr | FACET()} {ASC | DESC}] [LIMIT [offset,] count]
```

Multiple facet declarations need to be separated by an whitespace.

### Faceting by aggregation over another attribute

Data can be faceted by aggregating another attribute or expression. For example if the documents contain both the brand id and name, we can return in facet the brand names, but aggregate the brand ids. This can be done by using `FACET {expr1} BY {expr2}`


<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT * FROM facetdemo FACET brand_name by brand_id;
```

<!-- response -->

```sql
+------+-------+----------+---------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------------------------------+------------+
| id   | price | brand_id | title               | brand_name  | property    | j                                     | categories |
+------+-------+----------+---------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------------------------------+------------+
|    1 |   306 |        1 | Product Ten Three   | Brand One   | Six_Ten     | {"prop1":66,"prop2":91,"prop3":"One"} | 10,11      |
|    2 |   400 |       10 | Product Three One   | Brand Ten   | Four_Three  | {"prop1":69,"prop2":19,"prop3":"One"} | 13,14      |

| Brand Ten   |      998 |
| Brand Five  |     1007 |

```

<!-- end -->

<!-- example Example_3 -->

### Facet over multi-level grouping

Facets can aggregate over multi-level grouping, the result set being the same as the query would perform a multi-level grouping:

<!-- request -->

```sql
SELECT *,INTERVAL(price,200,400,600,800) AS price_range FROM facetdemo 
FACET price_range AS price_range,brand_name ORDER BY brand_name asc;
```

<!-- response -->

```sql
+------+-------+----------+---------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------------------------------+------------+-------------+
| id   | price | brand_id | title               | brand_name  | property    | j                                     | categories | price_range |
+------+-------+----------+---------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------------------------------+------------+-------------+
|    1 |   306 |        1 | Product Ten Three   | Brand One   | Six_Ten     | {"prop1":66,"prop2":91,"prop3":"One"} | 10,11      |           1 |
...
+------+-------+----------+---------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------------------------------+------------+-------------+
20 rows in set (0.00 sec)

+--------------+-------------+----------+
| fprice_range | brand_name  | count(*) |
+--------------+-------------+----------+
|            1 | Brand Eight |      197 |
|            4 | Brand Eight |      235 |
|            3 | Brand Eight |      203 |
|            2 | Brand Eight |      201 |
|            0 | Brand Eight |      197 |
|            4 | Brand Five  |      230 |
|            2 | Brand Five  |      197 |
|            1 | Brand Five  |      204 |
|            3 | Brand Five  |      193 |
|            0 | Brand Five  |      183 |
|            1 | Brand Four  |      195 |
...
```
<!-- end -->

### Ordering in facet result

<!-- example Example_4 -->

Facets support `ORDER BY` clause as same as a standard query. Each facet can have it's or own ordering and the facet ordering doesn't affect in any way the ordering of the main result set, which is ordered by the main query's `ORDER BY`. Sorting can be made on attribute name, count (using `COUNT(*)`) or special `FACET()` function can be used, which provides the aggregated data values.


<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT * FROM facetdemo 
FACET brand_name BY brand_id ORDER BY FACET() ASC 
FACET brand_name BY brand_id ORDER BY brand_name ASC
FACET brand_name BY brand_id order BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

<!-- response -->

```sql
+------+-------+----------+---------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------------------------------+------------+

10 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

### Size of facet result

<!-- example Example_4 -->

By default each facet result set is limited to 20 values. The number of facet values can be controlled with `LIMIT` clause individually for each facet  by providing either a number of values to return in format `LIMIT count` or with an offset as `LIMIT offset, count`. 

The maximum facet values that can be returned is limited by the query's `max_matches` setting. In case dynamic max_matches (limiting max_matches to offset+per page for better performance) is wanted to be implemented, it must be taken in account that a too low max_matches value can hurt the number of facet values. In this case, a minimum max_matches value should be used good enough to cover the number of facet values.

### Returned result set


When using SQL, a search with facets returns a multiple result sets response. The MySQL client/library/connector used **must** have support (most do) for multiple result sets in order to be able to access the facet result sets.



## Performance



<!-- example  Example_5 -->

Internally, the `FACET` is a shorthand for executing a multi-query where the first query contains the main search query and the rest of the queries in the batch have each a clustering. As in the case of multi-query, the common query optimization can kick-in for a faceted search, meaning the search query is executed only once and the facets operates on the search query result, each facet adding only a fraction of time to the total query time.


To check if the faceted search ran in an optimized mode can be seen in [query log](Logging/Query_logging.md), where all the logged queries will contain a `xN` string, where `N` is the number of queries that ran in the optimized group or checking the output of [SHOW META](Profiling_and_monitoring/SHOW_META.md) statement which will exhibit a `multiplier` metric:

<!-- request -->

```sql
SELECT * FROM facetdemo FACET brand_id FACET price FACET categories;
SHOW META LIKE 'multiplier';
```

<!-- response -->

```sql
+------+-------+----------+---------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------------------------------+------------+
| id   | price | brand_id | title               | brand_name  | property    | j                                     | categories |
