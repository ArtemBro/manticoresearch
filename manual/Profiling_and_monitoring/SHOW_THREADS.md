# SHOW THREADS 

```sql
SHOW THREADS [ OPTION columns=width[,format=sphinxql][,format=all] ]
```

<!-- example SHOW THREADS -->

`SHOW THREADS` is an SQL statement that lists all threads information about what they are doing at the moment.

It returns a table with following columns:

* `Tid`: id assigned to the thread by the kernel
* `Name`: thread name, you can also see this name in `top`, `htop`, `ps` and other unix tools to monitor thread's statistics
* `Proto`: connection protocol, possible values are `sphinx`, `mysql`, `http`, `ssl`, `compressed` and `replication` or combination (e.g. `http,ssl` or `compressed,mysql`)
* `State`: thread state, possible values are `handshake`, `net_read`, `net_write`, `query`, `net_idle`
* `Host`: `ip:port` of the client
* `ConnID`: connection id (starting from 0)
* `Time`: current job's duration (in seconds, with microsecond precision) or uptime of the thread in case of `format=all` when the thread is idling
* `Work time`: uptime of the thread
* `Work time CPU`: effective CPU time (requires [`--cpustats`](Starting_the_server/Manually#searchd-command-line-options))
* `Jobs done`: how many jobs this thread has completed
* `Last job took`: last job's duration
* `In idle`: whether the thread is idling now or when it was last idling
* `Info`: information about the query, can have multiple queries in case the query is against a distributed index or a real-time index

<!-- example SHOW THREADS WIDTH -->

`Info` column shows:

* raw text of queries run through Manticore SQL interface
* full text syntax, comments and data size for queries run via internal Manticore binary protocol (e.g. from a remote Manticore instance)

Maximum width of the `Info` column can be limited by specifying the `columns=N` option (notice the second row in the example table).

By default, queries are shown in their original format. When the `format=sphinxql` option is specified, the queries will be shown in SQL format regardless of protocol through which they were executed.

`format=all` displays all threads, otherwise idling threads are hidden.
